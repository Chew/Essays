# Essays

This is a repository of Essays I've written for school.

Obviously specific info will be censored.

This is licensed under CC0, which means you have full rights to use any of my essays for informational use or as examples only. If you use this in any of your actual essays, don't come crying to me if my repo shows up on your plagorism checkers.

The essays are simply copy pasted here from documents I've submitted, usually professors want specific times new roman and stuff or whatever.

Each file's front matter contains a mini synopsis of what I was supposed to do, as well as the due date. You are free to PR (in this case, peer review) my essays so long as the due date isn't in the past. 

I hope this repo is helpful!

To my professors: If this repo shows up on your plagorism checker, bro it's me i wrote it smh

To any other professors: I warned them...
